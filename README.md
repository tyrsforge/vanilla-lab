# Vanilla LAB

_A small corner of the web to rediscover simplicity._

---

## What is this?

**vanilla-lab** is a personal space where I step away from the constant flow of tools, frameworks, meta-frameworks, and abstractions that make up the modern frontend ecosystem.

I enjoy learning new technologies — including AI tools and workflows — and I actively use them in my development process.  
But sometimes, to stay grounded, I like to return to the essentials.

## Why this repository?

Because sometimes I miss the old days.  
The days when building something for the web was as simple as:

-   creating an `index.html`,
-   writing plain CSS,
-   adding a bit of JavaScript,
-   and opening the file directly in the browser.

No builds.  
No dependencies.  
No advanced configs.  
Just the web, as it was.

And after a while…  
**I realized I missed the simplicity and clarity of building things from scratch.**

This repository is my way of reconnecting with that feeling — a place to create layouts, small UI components, visual challenges, and anything that sparks curiosity, using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

## What you’ll find here

Inside the `challenges/` folder, each mini-project lives in its own directory:

-   `index.html`
-   `style.css`
-   `main.js` (only when needed)

Each challenge is isolated and intentionally simple — just like the early days of the web.

## Philosophy

> **Simplicity as a refuge.  
> Nostalgia as inspiration.  
> Learning as play.**

If you’re reading this: welcome.  
Take a moment, open your editor, and enjoy the calm of building without pressure.
